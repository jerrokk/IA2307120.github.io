                  <p>and understanding my computer more. This led me to my career choice in Computer Science.</p>
                  <p>and my ambition and passion for computers is what is leading me to my career choice because</p>
                    <p>I know it's something I'll love for a long time.</p>

        <br>
        <p>When I first stumbled upon this video I wasn't really motivated</p>
        <p>in what I was pursuing, but after watching it I felt like he really understood</p>
        <p>what I felt and I saw that he followed what he believed in which was tennis and</p>
        <p>he was one of the world's best; since then I knew I can do it too.</p>

                <p>In general I think the test is very good if you want to get a quick</p>
                <p>understanding of the type of person you are. It does a good job of asking</p>
                <p>questions that make you think about yourself and how you would react in</p>

                <br>

                <p>In my case I think the test represents me mostly accurately, in no way I</p>
                <p>I see myself as that much as an introvert but the other aspects I do see in myself.</p>
